    A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

    A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

    For example, array A such that:

        A[0] = 4
        A[1] = 1
        A[2] = 3
        A[3] = 2

    is a permutation, but array A such that:

        A[0] = 4
        A[1] = 1
        A[2] = 3

    is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

    The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

    Write a function:

        class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

    that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

    For example, given array A such that:

        A[0] = 4
        A[1] = 1
        A[2] = 3
        A[3] = 2

    the function should return 1.

    Given array A such that:

        A[0] = 4
        A[1] = 1
        A[2] = 3
    the function should return 0.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
