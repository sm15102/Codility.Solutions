    A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:

    S is empty;
    S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
    S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
    For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.

    Write a function:

        class Solution { public int solution(String S); }

    that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if string S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

    For example, given S = "(()(())())", the function should return 1 and given S = "())", the function should return 0, as explained above.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000];
    string S consists only of the characters "(" and/or ")".
