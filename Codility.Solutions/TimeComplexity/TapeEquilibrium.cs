     A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.

    Any integer P, such that 0 < P < N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: A[0], A[1], ..., A[P − 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N − 1].

    The difference between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N − 1])|

    In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.

    For example, consider array A such that:

      A[0] = 3
      A[1] = 1
      A[2] = 2
      A[3] = 4
      A[4] = 3

    We can split this tape in four places:

    P = 1, difference = |3 − 10| = 7
    P = 2, difference = |4 − 9| = 5
    P = 3, difference = |6 − 7| = 1
    P = 4, difference = |10 − 3| = 7
    Write a function:

        class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

    that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.

    For example, given:

      A[0] = 3
      A[1] = 1
      A[2] = 2
      A[3] = 4
      A[4] = 3
    the function should return 1, as explained above.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
